        <p> <b>The front end of an application is absolutely critical to the visual aspects of the app. Through the utilization of HTML, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), developers can incorporate effects and stylistic preferences. UI/UX also plays an essential role in front-end development, as users will gain the best experience through intentional UI/UX implementation.</b> </p>
        <br>
        <p>Some examples of front-end applications that enable web languages are <b>HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. </b> These three examples, as mentioned above, are essential to the development and accessibility of an interface.

            · HTML lays the actual foundation for every site that lives on the web through enablement of page display. Without HTML, the Internet browser does not have any information about the layout and display of a page. The process begins with parsing, ensuring that every tag in the file is considered and included. <br>
            <br>
            
            · JavaScript is text-based and is used in front-end application development. This front-end application is the key that provides the interactive elements of a web page that the user directly engages with. Formatted around its own unique language, JavaScript dynamically interprets each singular piece of code, one at a time. Functioning as a programming language, it verifies the code in real time to ensure a seamless interface process.
            <br>
            <br>
            · CSS determines the layout and style of web pages. This front-end application is critical for complete customization of a web page, as it enables adjustment and modification of every element of the content, including font size, spacing, animations. </p>

            <p> <b>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.</b> </p>
            <br>
            <p>Build and maintain websites: A back-end developer’s main responsibility is to use various tools, frameworks, and languages to determine how best to develop intuitive, user-friendly prototypes and turn them into websites. This requires an understanding of cross-platform functionality and compatibility. <br>

                - <b>Write high-quality code:</b> To produce sustainable web applications, developers must write clean and easily maintainable code. <br>
                
                - <b>Perform quality assurance (QA) testing: </b> Create and oversee testing schedules to optimize user interface and experience, ensuring optimal display on various browsers and devices.
                <br>
                - <b>Assess efficiency and speed:</b> Once a website is up and running, and during updates and edits, developers need to assess its performance and scalability, adjusting code as necessary.
                <br>
                - <b>Troubleshoot and debug:</b> Be able to troubleshoot issues and resolve them, while communicating them to project managers, stakeholders, and QA teams.
                <br>
                - <b>Train and support:</b> Maintain workflows with client teams to ensure ongoing support, along with leading training and mentorship for junior developers.</p>
